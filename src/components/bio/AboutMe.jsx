        Hello!
        <br />
        <br />
        I&apos;m DeKayla Phillips-Sterling, a passionate Full-Stack Software
        Engineer who dove head-first into the world of technology in 2021. My
        journey through tech began amidst the vibrant era of social media, where
        I first dipped my toes into the waters of HTML and CSS, customizing
        Tumblr profiles with youthful zeal and creative spark.
        <br />
        <br />
        My route to software engineering has been rich and varied—spanning
        self-directed learning, academia, immersive bootcamps, and hands-on
        apprenticeship. This diverse pathway has shaped me into a polyglot
        developer with a unique blend of skills, technical acumen, and an
        insatiable curiosity for learning.
        <br />
        <br />
        My technical journey is marked by a tapestry of languages and
        frameworks—I revel in the syntax of JavaScript, Python, and Typescript,
        and construct digital experiences with React, Django, and Node.js. I
        find joy in the rhythm of code and the challenge of transforming complex
        problems into elegant solutions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beyond code, I thrive on growth and reflection. I&apos;ve honed a deep
        understanding of my learning style, strengths, and the areas where
        there&apos;s always room to expand. This introspective approach fuels my
        adaptability and readiness to dive into new software paradigms with
        enthusiasm.
        <br />
        <br />
        Today, armed with a multifaceted toolkit and the tenacity of a lifelong
        learner, I stand poised to contribute to innovative projects and
        collaborative teams. I&apos;m not just seeking a role—I&apos;m seeking a
        community where I can continue to evolve and where my journey can
        inspire and intersect with others in crafting the future of technology.
